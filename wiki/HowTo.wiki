= How to Build =

This project is Maven based, so you can build & install a local copy by executing:

<code>mvn clean install</code>

= How to Deploy =

Maven is also used to deploy this project's build artifacts.
   * Jars, wars and poms are uploaded to a project-only micro [http://code.google.com/p/big-oh/source/browse/#svn/repos/releases/net/big_oh repository].
   * The project's Maven-generated [http://code.google.com/p/big-oh/source/browse/#svn/site/1.BigOhSoftwareFrameworksAndTools site] is deployed to source control using the [https://wagon-svn.dev.java.net/ wagon-svn plugin].  That plugin unfortunately does not properly apply mime-type auto-properties.  As a result, some command-line intervention is necessary.
      * <code>find . -name "*.html" -exec svn propset svn:mime-type text/html '{}' \;</code>
      * <code>find . -name "*.css" -exec svn propset svn:mime-type text/css '{}' \;</code>
